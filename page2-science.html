    <h3>Changes in motion caused by forces (gravity, friction)
</h3>
<hr/>
<p>Motion can be straight (like an arrow being shot at a target), circular (like a merry-go-round), up and down (like a pogo stick), zig-zag (like skiing), side-to-side (like dancing).
Some motion is a combination, like a swing. When you are swinging you are moving up and down, as well as forward and back. When the same motion repeats over and over, it creates a pattern.
A pendulum is a weight on a string that hangs from a single point. Pendulums swing to create a pattern of motion. The length of the string affects the pattern it creates. For example, short strings swing fast. Pendulums will continue to swing in the same pattern until a force, such as friction, stops them.
If we know the pattern that a moving object is following, we can make predictions about where it will be in the future. For example, when you jump rope you are using the pattern to predict when to jump.
You can use information from patterns to make lots of predictions, like how many swings you can do at recess or when to swing your baseball bat to hit a ball.
When you rub your hands together on a cold day to warm them up, you are using friction.
Friction slows things down and creates heat. All types of matter can cause friction, even air! Air resistance is a form of friction that slows down cars, trains, and airplanes. Scientists design their shape to reduce friction from the air. This is called streamlining.
Some surfaces cause more friction than others, like rough surfaces. The treads on the bottom of your sneakers keep you from slipping. In this case, friction is beneficial.
Sometimes you want less friction. Air resistance is a form of friction that slows down all moving objects. Cars, trains, and airplanes are designed to reduce air resistance. This is called streamlining.
Another way to reduce friction is to change the types of materials that contact each other. If you have a squeaky door hinge, the noise is created when parts of door rub against each other. Adding a lubricant, such as oil or grease, will make the squeak go away.

<h3> Electricity and magnetism (conductors, insulators)</h3>
<hr/>
<p>All magnets have a north and south pole. Magnetic poles are the strongest parts of a magnet.

North and south poles of magnets attract each other. The two south poles and the two north poles repel each other.
A magnetic field is the area around a magnet that attracts and repeal objects. If you place an object inside the magnet’s field, it will be attracted to the magnet. The simplest way to see a magnetic field is to sprinkle iron filings around a magnet.
Iron filings are tiny pieces of iron. When sprinkled around a magnet, they reveal the magnetic field.
The Earth also has a magnetic field – it is like a huge magnet. Compasses work because the needle inside the compass is a magnet. One side of the needle is the north pole and the other side of the needle is the south pole. The north pole of the needle is attracted to the North Pole and the south pole of a needle is attracted to the South Pole.
Magnetism works over a distance. However, the closer the objects are to each other, the stronger the magnetic force. If you try to pull magnets apart it is very hard because the magnets are so close to each other. Once you get them a little bit apart it is much easier.
An electromagnet is a magnet that uses electricity. The strength of an electromagnet can be changed by changing the amount of electricity that it is connected to.
By taking away the electricity running through the electromagnet, it can be turned off. In the video, Dr. Jeff used an electromagnet to pick up paper clips. When he pulled the wires off the battery, the paper clips fell off.
Electromagnets are used to power doorbells, construction cranes, and speakers.
Magnets called permanent magnets cannot be turned off. These magnets do not electricity to work.
Static electricity is the buildup of the electrical charge in an object when it is rubbed against another object.
Static electricity causes objects to stick together when they have opposite charges and repel when they have the same charge.
Common examples of this include rubbing a party balloon on your head. Electrical charge is transferred between the balloon and your hair. They develop OPPOSITE charges which make the balloon be attracted to your hair.
Also, if you shuffle your feet across the carpet and then touch a doorknob, that is static electricity too. The charges were built up when your feet were rubbing on the carpet, and then the charge was transferred to the metal doorknob.

<h3>Weather and climate</h3>
<hr/>
<p>Climate is the average weather conditions in a place over a long period of time—30 years or more. And as you probably already know, there are lots of different types of climates on Earth.
For example, hot regions are normally closest to the equator. The climate is hotter there because the Sun’s light is most directly overhead at the equator. And the North and South Poles are cold because the Sun’s light and heat are least direct there.
Today, climate scientists split the Earth into approximately five main types of climates. They are:
A: Tropical. In this hot and humid zone, the average temperatures are greater than 64°F (18°C) year-round and there is more than 59 inches of precipitation each year.
B: Dry. These climate zones are so dry because moisture is rapidly evaporated from the air and there is very little precipitation.
C: Temperate. In this zone, there are typically warm and humid summers with thunderstorms and mild winters.
D. Continental. These regions have warm to cool summers and very cold winters. In the winter, this zone can experience snowstorms, strong winds, and very cold temperatures—sometimes falling below -22°F (-30°C)!
E: Polar. In the polar climate zones, it’s extremely cold. Even in summer, the temperatures here never go higher than 50°F (10°C)!
Weather satellites mostly help with tracking conditions that are happening right now and forecasting weather in the near future. However, they also collect information that helps us monitor a region’s climate over time.
